# NetSnap Privacy Policy (MVP)

Last updated: 2026-01-10

NetSnap (“we”, “us”) is a payout/statement analyzer. This policy explains what information we handle, why we handle it, and the limits of an MVP.

## 1) What information we handle

### A) Login email and license key
When you unlock NetSnap, you enter an email and a license key. We use them to verify access.

- We do not sell your email.
- We do not use your email to build advertising profiles.

### B) Files you upload for analysis
When you upload payout/statement files, NetSnap reads them to generate summaries and tables.

**MVP design goal:** NetSnap is built to analyze files during your session and not intentionally keep a long-term “user vault” or history.

**Reality check:** Like most web apps, files may be temporarily held in memory while the app runs. Depending on hosting, limited technical logs may exist (see “Basic technical logs”).

### C) “Help Speed-up Development” (optional)
If you opt in, NetSnap creates a **redacted sample bundle** and emails it to the developer to help build/improve platform adapters.

The bundle is designed to include:
- column names
- a small preview of rows (redacted)
- basic metadata (file name, row/column counts, adapter guess)

**Important: redaction is best-effort, not a guarantee.**  
Redaction reduces risk, but it may not catch every sensitive value in every file format. Only opt in if you’re comfortable with that risk, and do not upload highly sensitive personal data.

### D) Bug reports (optional)
If you send a bug report, we receive the text you submit and your email if you include it. Bug reports are used for support and fixing issues.

### E) Basic technical logs (normal for web apps)
Even if we don’t want to “collect data,” a web app still receives basic technical information so it can function, such as:
- IP address (or network address)
- device/browser type
- timestamps
- error messages generated by the app

We use this type of information to keep the app running, prevent abuse, and troubleshoot problems.

---

## 2) How we use information
We use information only to:
- run the analysis you requested
- verify access to the app
- fix bugs and improve platform support (especially when you opt in)
- respond to support requests you send

---

## 3) What we do NOT do (trust commitments)
- We do **not** sell your personal information.
- We do **not** rent your personal information.
- We do **not** share your information with third parties for their marketing or advertising.
- We do **not** run ads based on your uploaded files.

---

## 4) Who we share information with

### A) Service providers (hosting + email)
To operate NetSnap, some information may be processed by service providers (for example, the platform hosting the app and the service used to deliver email).

We share only what’s needed to provide the service you’re using (example: sending your opt-in bundle to the developer inbox).

### B) Legal requests
If we are required by law to disclose information (court order, valid legal process), we may have to comply.

---

## 5) Retention (how long it sticks around)
- **Uploaded files for analysis:** Designed to be processed during your session and not intentionally stored as long-term user history. Temporary caching or logs may exist depending on hosting.
- **Opt-in redacted bundles and bug reports:** These land in our support/development inbox. We keep them only as long as they are useful for support and development, then delete when no longer needed.

---

## 6) Your choices & deletion requests
You can request deletion of:
- opt-in redacted bundles you sent
- bug reports you submitted
- support emails you sent us

Email: profit.truth.data.coletection@gmail.com

To help us find it, include:
- the email address used
- approximate date/time you sent it
- subject line (if you have it)

**Limits:** We can delete items we control (like our inbox copies). We may not be able to delete records held by third-party providers’ security logs or backups immediately.

---

## 7) Security (what we do and what we can’t promise)
We take reasonable steps for an MVP, such as:
- keeping credentials in secrets storage (so keys aren’t committed to the repo)
- limiting access to admin credentials
- using secure connections where supported by hosting

But no internet service can guarantee perfect security. If you upload sensitive personal data, you increase your risk unnecessarily.

---

## 8) What counts as “highly sensitive”?
Please do **not** upload or send any of the following (even if you plan to use the redacted bundle). Redaction is best-effort and may not catch everything.

Examples:
- Government ID numbers (SSN, driver’s license, passport, tax IDs like EIN/TIN)
- Full bank account details (account numbers, routing numbers, IBAN/SWIFT), check images
- Full payment card numbers, CVV/security codes, or PINs
- Account credentials (passwords, API keys, access tokens, recovery codes)
- Medical information, insurance member IDs, or details about someone’s health
- Unredacted customer lists containing names + contact details (email/phone/address)
- Anything that could enable identity theft, account takeover, or financial fraud

If a file contains any of the above, remove it first or export a version that excludes it before uploading.

---

## 9) Changes to this policy
We may update this Privacy Policy as NetSnap evolves. When we do, we will change the “Last updated” date at the top of this page.
